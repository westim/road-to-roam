## Gameplay

This game is heavily inspired by the 1991 Windows game, [SkiFree](https://ski.ihoc.net/). The game can still be downloaded & played on modern Windows systems. Microsoft has also released a similar game called [Surf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_(video_game)) as an Easter Egg in the modern Edge browser.

The goal is to survive as long as possible.

Control options:

- Arrow keys
- Pointer tracking
